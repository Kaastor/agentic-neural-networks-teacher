# Canonical Content

The repository currently delivers the **Backpropagation** module as part of Milestone 1.

## Modules

- `backpropagation` â€“ closed-book curriculum with:
  - 12 instructional sections spanning history, derivations, implementation, and diagnostics
  - 5 learning objectives tied to Bloom's taxonomy and sequencing metadata
  - 5 canonical facts with proofs/derivations and pitfalls
  - 3 worked examples (two derivations, one tooling walkthrough)
  - 10 deterministic problem templates (8 theory/analysis problems, 2 coding labs)

All content is available through the read-only FastAPI service via `GET /concept/concept-backpropagation` and `GET /facts`.
