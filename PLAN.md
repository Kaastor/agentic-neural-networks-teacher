Below is a **comprehensive implementation plan** you can execute like a real program of work. It’s tuned for a **Senior ML Engineer focused on agentic LLM systems** in **personalized education** (deep **Neural Networks Fundamentals**). I default to a **closed‑book, curriculum‑graph first** design (max reliability), with **RAG as an optional extension** after MVP.

---

## 0) TL;DR (what you’ll build)

* A **Planner–Tutor–Assessor–Critic** agent graph that adapts to each learner, verified by tools (symbolic math, unit‑tested code labs), tracked by **knowledge tracing** + **spaced repetition**.
* **Curriculum Graph** of NN fundamentals (canonical facts, derivations, problem templates, unit tests), **no web dependency** in MVP.
* Production‑grade **observability, evaluation, safety, cost control**, and **rollbacks**.

---

## 1) Architecture overview (top‑level)

```
                ┌──────────────── Session Orchestrator (Graph Controller) ────────────────┐
User UI  ⇄  API │  Planner/Router  →  (calls)  Tutor  →  Assessor/Grader  →  Critic/QA   │
                │                ↘               ↙                  ↘        ↙            │
                │         Retrieval* (optional)  │         Math Deriver  Code Runner      │
                │                                  (SymPy)           (sandbox, PyTorch)   │
                └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                    │            │           │             │
                         Curriculum Graph   Knowledge Trace  Content Store  Telemetry/Logs
                           (concepts/LOs)   (BKT/DKT/IRT)    (notes, labs)  (traces, costs)

*RAG extension after MVP. MVP grounds in internal canonical content only.
```

**Key pattern:** **Plan → Act → Verify (Reflect)** with tool‑verified steps and strict grounding to canonical content.

---

## 2) Dependencies & technologies

**Language & runtime**

* Python 3.11+, uv/poetry for env mgmt, Ruff+Black+MyPy (lint/type)
* FastAPI (backend), Pydantic v2 (schemas), Uvicorn (ASGI)

---

## 3) Models you’ll need (roles & selection)

1. **Planner/Tutor LLM (primary)**

   * Strength: planning, pedagogy, tool use, function‑calling JSON.
   * Settings: temperature low‑mid (0.2–0.5) for explain; 0.0–0.2 for grading outputs.

2. **Critic & Judge LLM (secondary)**

   * Cheaper model that validates: faithfulness to canonical facts, rubric scoring of free‑text, style/tone.
   * Returns **structured JSON verdicts** only.

3. **Knowledge‑tracing model**

   * Start with **Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT)** per LO.
   * Upgrade to **DKT** (simple GRU) once you have sequences; or **IRT‑2PL** to calibrate item difficulty.

4. **Safety & taxonomy**

   * PII detector + request classifier (learning vs off‑topic).
   * (Optional) reranker/embedding model for RAG later.

**Model router policy**

* If tool calls present or complexity>τ → primary LLM; otherwise **router** sends to judge/smaller model for short hints.
* Pin versions; maintain fallback (N‑1) model.

---

## 4) Infrastructure plan

**Environments**

* **Dev** (single‑node k8s/Kind), **Staging**, **Prod** (multi‑AZ)
* IaC via Terraform (VPC, subnets, SGs, RDS, S3, EKS)

**Services (k8s deployments)**

* `api-gateway` (FastAPI), `orchestrator` (LangGraph), `code-runner` (isolated namespace), `math-service`, `grading-service`
* `content-service` (Curriculum Graph CRUD, read‑only in prod)
* `telemetry` (OTEL collector), `worker-queue` (RQ/Celery)

**Networking**

* API Gateway/Ingress with WAF (rate limit & IP allow‑lists for admin)
* Private subnets for stateful services; VPC endpoints for object store

**Data**

* Postgres with read replica; PITR enabled
* S3 bucket policies + server‑side encryption; lifecycle for artifacts

**CI/CD**

* Pipelines: unit/integration tests → build minimal images → scan → deploy to staging → run smoke/e2e suite → manual gate to prod
* Canary deploy with feature flag for agent graph version

**Observability**

* Tracing every LLM/tool call (prompt token count, latency, cost)
* Dashboards: costs per session, tool error rate, hallucination flags, mastery gain

**Security & privacy**

* PII redaction at ingress; per‑tenant encryption keys (if B2B)
* No network egress from sandboxes; signed tool invocations (JWT with short TTL)

## 5) Step‑by‑step milestones (with sub‑steps & DoD)

### Milestone 0 — Foundations (repo + standards)

* [ ] Monorepo structure (`/services`, `/agents`, `/content`, `/infra`, `/eval`)
* [ ] Tooling: poetry/uv, Ruff/Black/MyPy, pre‑commit, Makefile
* [ ] CI (lint+tests) + image build + vulnerability scanning
* **DoD:** Green CI; reproducible dev env; one “hello agent” flow returns JSON.

### Milestone 1 — Curriculum Graph & Canonical Content (closed‑book)

* [ ] Schema: `Concept`, `LearningObjective`, `CanonicalFact`, `ProblemTemplate`, `WorkedExample`
* [ ] Author **Backprop module** first: 12–20 pages, 8+ problems, 2 coding labs
* [ ] Write unit tests for templates (parameterized generators)
* [ ] Read‑only `content-service` API (`GET /concept/{id}`, `GET /facts?ids=...`)
* **DoD:** Can query a concept and its canonical facts; templates generate valid items deterministically.

### Milestone 2 — Tooling: Math & Code

* [ ] `math-service`: SymPy equivalence, derivative checker (Jacobians); APIs:

  * `POST /check/derivative`, `POST /check/equality`
* [ ] `code-runner`: containerized sandbox (gVisor/Firecracker), network‑off; API:

  * `POST /run` (code, limits) → logs, artifacts, exit code
* [ ] Unit tests: gradient checking harness for MLP; runtime quotas; kill untrusted syscalls
* **DoD:** Given canonical solution code, unit tests pass; invalid code times out safely.

### Milestone 3 — Agent Graph MVP (Planner–Tutor–Assessor–Critic)

* [ ] Typed messages (Pydantic) between nodes; idempotent retries
* [ ] **Planner** picks next step (explain/derive/quiz/code) from LearnerState + Curriculum
* [ ] **Tutor**: Socratic style; function calls only; refuses to state facts w/o canonical fetch
* [ ] **Assessor**: instantiates `ProblemTemplate`; **Grader** runs tests or rubric
* [ ] **Critic**: verifies faithfulness to canonical facts & math/code checks; can request re‑try
* **DoD:** End‑to‑end “thin slice” session for Backprop module with verified math/code.

### Milestone 4 — Knowledge Tracing & Personalization

* [ ] Implement **BKT** with parameters per LO; API `POST /trace/update`
* [ ] Difficulty selection policy (Elo/IRT‑like) + spaced repetition scheduler (Leitner)
* [ ] Onboarding diagnostic → initial mastery vector

* **DoD:** Nightly eval report auto‑generated; dashboards live; alert routes configured.

### Milestone 6 — Safety & Policy

* [ ] PII detector, jailbreak filter; tool allow‑list in prompts
* [ ] Refusal policies (no chain‑of‑thought to user; “concise rationale” only)
* [ ] Red‑team test suite for injection & sandbox escapes
* **DoD:** ≥99.5% block rate on known injection prompts; runner passes exploit tests.

### Milestone 7 — Product UI & UX

* [ ] Next.js app: chat, code cell, plots, math rendering; progress view (LO mastery)
* [ ] “Why this step?” tooltip (shows LO & prerequisites, not CoT)
* [ ] Session resume; export artifacts (plots, notebook)
* **DoD:** Usable tutor with stable p95 latencies; design QAed.

### Milestone 8 — Scale & Hardening

* [ ] Semantic/prompt caching; streaming; request coalescing
* [ ] Canary + rollback; autoscaling; budget guards (per‑user, per‑org)
* [ ] Cost/perf experiments (router thresholds, prompt compaction)
* **DoD:** Meets SLOs under 10× synthetic load with budget protections.

### Milestone 9 (Optional) — RAG Extension

* [ ] Ingest curated NN corpus; build embeddings; hybrid BM25+dense
* [ ] Retrieval agent + reranker; **faithfulness check** enforced by Critic
* [ ] Add citation renderer in UI
* **DoD:** Faithfulness ≥0.98 on held‑out Q/A; retrieval hit‑rate meets target.

## 6) How it works (E2E flows) & why it will work

### Onboarding & plan

1. User sets goals + prior knowledge → **Diagnostic** (mixed items).
2. **BKT** computes mastery per LO; **Planner** chooses first concept respecting prerequisites.
3. **Tutor** starts Socratic dialog; fetches canonical content snippets for grounding.

**Why it works:** Knowledge tracing + prerequisite closure prevents gaps; grounding to curated facts prevents drift.

### Derivation flow (Backprop example)

1. Planner selects **Derivation** for LO‑BP‑001.
2. Tutor asks a probing question; calls **math‑service** to validate each step (e.g., `dL/dW = δ ⊗ hᵗ`).
3. If a step fails equality check → Critic requests correction or simpler path.

**Why it works:** Tool‑verified steps eliminate silent math hallucinations; Socratic prompts improve retention.

### Code lab flow

1. Assessor instantiates lab (MLP forward/backward skeleton) with unit tests.
2. Code Runner executes user code; **Grader** checks numeric vs analytic gradients.
3. Tutor offers targeted hints (from **common‑pitfalls** in the template metadata).

**Why it works:** Programmatic tests + finite‑difference checks give objective correctness; hints are anchored in known pitfalls.

### Quiz/assessment flow

1. Assessor picks item with difficulty near learner theta.
2. Grader scores; **Judge LLM** applies rubric for short answers.
3. Knowledge trace updates; **Scheduler** plans spaced review.

**Why it works:** IRT/BKT adaptivity maximizes learning gain; spaced repetition solidifies memory.

## 8) Design patterns & “LLM methods” a Senior engineer should know

**Planning & decomposition**

* **ReAct** (reason+act with tools) adapted to strict function calling.
* **Plan‑and‑Execute** with **reflection**: Planner crafts minimal step; Critic requests re‑plan on failure.
* **Task graphs (LangGraph)**: explicit states, no hidden recursion.

**Grounding & generation**

* **Closed‑book canonical grounding**: all facts pulled by ID; content store is the source of truth.
* **(Optional) RAG Triad**: retriever→reranker→reader; citations; chunking by concept boundaries.

**Verification & meta‑evaluation**

* **LLM‑as‑a‑Judge**: structured JSON rubric; calibrate with human audits.
* **Chain‑of‑Verification (CoVe)**: independent model re‑derives key claims.
* **Self‑consistency (k‑vote)** for high‑stakes long answers; cost‑gated.
* **Constrained decoding**: JSON Schema & regex to prevent free‑form drift.
* **Symbolic/numeric checks**: SymPy equality; gradient finite differences; unit tests.
* **Canary facts**: insert known probes to detect hallucination.

**Orchestration & state**

* **Manager–Worker** agents; workers stateless; Manager owns **SessionState**.
* **Policy objects**: routing policy, retry policy, fallback policy.

**Robustness & safety**

* **Prompt hardening** (tool allow‑list, “do not change system instructions” sentinels).
* **Jailbreak & PII filters**; **signed tool intents**.
* **Idempotency keys** on tool calls; exponential backoff with jitter.

**Efficiency & cost**

* **Router**: small model for “micro‑turns,” big model for planning.
* **Prompt compression** (context distillation, summaries).
* **Semantic cache** for repeated queries; **streaming** outputs.
* **Speculative decoding** or **draft models** if provider supports.

**Model quality**

* **Distillation**: collect tutor transcripts → SFT a domain‑distilled model.
* **Continual evaluation**: pre/post tests, live A/B with guardrails.

**Pedagogy methods**

* **Socratic prompting**; **worked examples**; **error tagging**; **spaced repetition**; **interleaving**.

---

## 9) Reliability playbook

* **SLOs:** p95 latency 2.5s (no tools) / 6s (tools); tool success ≥ 98%; faithfulness ≥ 0.99 on canonical checks.
* **Circuit breakers:** if tool failure > threshold in last N mins → route to fallback explanation mode (no code).
* **Retries:** at most 1 retry per tool with backoff; idempotent tokens.
* **Health probes:** liveness/readiness for all services; synthetic user flows.
* **Canary deploy:** 5% traffic; auto‑rollback on SLO breach.
* **Incident runbook:** playbooks for “LLM outage,” “Code runner overload,” “DB saturation,” “Budget exceeded.”

---

## 10) Evaluation plan (what you’ll run continuously)

**Offline**

* Gold **Backprop** suite (derivations + code labs) with pass/fail.
* Faithfulness set: 500 Q/A mapped to canonical facts; Critic must flag any mismatch.
* Rubric calibration: human vs Judge agreement ≥ 0.9 Cohen’s κ.

**Online**

* Pre/post learning gains by cohort.
* Helpfulness (Likert), hint depth distributions, dropout vs difficulty mismatch.
* Cost per learning hour; token breakdown by agent/tool.

---

## 11) Concrete task backlog (pick‑up‑and‑do)

* [ ] Create pitfalls taxonomy (e.g., Jacobian orientation, broadcasting errors)

**Math & code tools**

* [ ] Implement `check_equality(expr_a, expr_b, assumptions)`
* [ ] Implement `check_gradients(f, params) → relative_error`
* [ ] Build MLP toy dataset generator; deterministic random seeds

**Agents**

* [ ] Planner policy: prerequisite closure + bandit for expected gain
* [ ] Tutor prompt set: Socratic rules, tool use contracts
* [ ] Assessor: item selection, instantiation, rubric library
* [ ] Critic: facts alignment; math/code verdict integration
* [ ] Safety: PII & jailbreak filters; allow‑listed tools

**Personalization**

* [ ] BKT params per LO; online update rule; API hook from Grader
* [ ] Spaced repetition scheduler; daily queue builder

**Ops**

* [ ] Budget guard (per‑session token cap, soft + hard)
* [ ] Canary toggles; rollout scripts; Terraform modules
* [ ] Dashboards: costs, latency by agent, mastery gain, hallucination rate

**Frontend**

* [ ] Chat UI with function‑call actions display
* [ ] Code cell + run button; show logs/artifacts
* [ ] Mastery heatmap per LO; “Why this step?” tooltip

**(Optional) RAG**

* [ ] Embedding ingestion; hybrid search; reranking

### Final note

Start **closed‑book** to lock correctness and pedagogy. Add **RAG** only when you need breadth/variety, keeping the **Critic & faithfulness** checks in the loop. This plan teaches you the **senior‑level methodology** *and* the **agentic LLM patterns** (planning, tool use, verification, evaluation, safety) you’ll use across any production LLM system.
