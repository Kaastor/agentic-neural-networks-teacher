Below is a **Senior Machine Learning Engineer–level project description** for an **agentic LLM system** that delivers **deep, personalized education on Neural Networks fundamentals**. It covers required skills and methodology, a robust agentic architecture, concrete requirements, technologies, and “must‑haves.” You can treat this like a design doc + build plan.

---

## 1) Executive summary

**Goal:** Build an **agentic tutoring system** that adapts to each learner, teaches *Neural Networks (NN) fundamentals in deep depth*, and demonstrates exemplary LLM-app design and senior ML engineering practice: rigorous evaluation, observability, safety, reliability, and cost/latency control.

**Core idea:** A **Planner–Tutor–Assessor–Critic** multi‑agent loop, grounded by retrieval over a curated NN knowledge base, formal learning objectives, and a **knowledge‑tracing** model that selects the right next activity (explain, derive, code, quiz, visualize). The system integrates a secure **code runner** (for Python/NumPy/PyTorch), **symbolic math** (for derivations like backprop), and **diagram generation** for conceptual clarity.

## 2) Success metrics (KPIs)

* **Learning gains:** Δ score from pre‑test to post‑test ≥ **+20 percentage points** for novice/intermediate cohorts.
* **Time‑to‑mastery:** Median modules mastered per hour ≥ **1.0** at advanced depth.
* **Helpfulness / pedagogical quality:** Human‑rated ≥ **4.4/5** using a rubric (accuracy, clarity, scaffolding, adaptivity).
* **Truthfulness & reliability:** Verified/hallucination rate ≤ **1%** on fact‑checked responses; tool‑use success ≥ **98%**.
* **Latency/cost:** p95 tutor turn latency ≤ **2.5s** without code execution; ≤ **6s** with code; **<\$X** per active learning hour (you’ll set budgets).
* **Safety:** Prompt‑injection success < **0.5%** on red‑team suites; no PII leakage.

3. **Assessment**

   * Item types: MCQ with distractor quality checks, short answer, derivations, coding.
   * **Auto‑grading** with programmatic tests + LLM‑rubric backup.
   * **Mastery gating**: progress only on ≥ threshold performance with stability.

4. **RAG & verification**

**Corpus**

* Curated lecture notes, derivations, simple labs; your own high‑signal content preferred to reduce citation drift. (External scraping is *not* required for MVP.)

---

## 9) Personalization & learning science

---

## 10) Agent roster & responsibilities

**Orchestration & agents**

* **LangGraph** or **Haystack Agents** (deterministic graph control).
* Alternative: **AutoGen**, **CrewAI** (if you prefer conversational multi‑agent patterns).

## 12) APIs & schemas (minimal contracts)

## 13) Evaluation methodology

**Offline**

* **Content‑grounded QA set** (1000+ Qs) spanning derivations, concept checks, coding.
* **Unit tests** for code items; **symbolic equality** checks for derivations.
* **RAG evals**: retriever hit‑rate (top‑k), faithfulness, attribution correctness.
* **Agentic ablations**: Planner on/off; Critic on/off; Reflection depth 1 vs 3.

**Online**

* **Pre/post tests** per learner + retention tests at 1–2 weeks.
* **A/B**: new prompts, models, planner policies; guard with cost/latency budgets.
* **Human rating**: double‑blind tutor quality rubric (accuracy, depth, scaffolding, empathy, adaptivity).

**Safety**

* Prompt‑injection suites; code‑runner exploit attempts; PII probes.

---

## 14) Risks & mitigations

* **Hallucinations / false derivations** → Critic + step‑verification; require citations; show uncertainty.
* **Prompt injection** → Tool allow‑list; system‑prompt hardening; sensitive ops require signed intents.
* **Sandbox escape** → VM isolation, network‑off, strict resource/time caps; syscall deny‑lists.
* **Pedagogical drift** → Rubric‑based reviews; periodic content audits; canonical references.
* **Cost/latency creep** → Cache hot chains; response truncation; distillation for frequent flows.

---

## 15) Must‑haves vs nice‑to‑haves

**Must‑haves**

* Planner–Tutor–Assessor–Critic loop with RAG + citations.
* Knowledge tracing (BKT baseline) + spaced repetition.
* Secure Python code runner + SymPy derivations.
* Structured telemetry, offline/online evals, prompt/version control.
* Safety guardrails (PII, injection, tool allow‑list).

**Nice‑to‑haves**

* KG‑augmented RAG with prerequisite path explanations.
* Domain‑distilled tutor model (SFT).
* Voice interface + diagram rendering to whiteboard.
* Cooperative multi‑turn **self‑play** for item generation.

---

## 16) Senior ML Engineer methodology & approach (how you’ll work)

1. **Clarify objectives & constraints** → lock KPIs, SLOs, budgets; define acceptance criteria.
2. **Design for evaluation first** → create gold tests (math/code/unit tests), RAG truth sets, tutor‑quality rubrics.
3. **Build narrow, deep MVP** → one module (e.g., Backprop & Optimization) end‑to‑end with all guardrails.
4. **Instrument everything** → traces (prompts, tools, costs), replayable sessions, regression alarms.
5. **Iterate with ablations** → evaluate each agentic component; keep what moves KPIs.
6. **Optimize** → caching, distilled sub‑models, prompt compilation, tool latency trims.
7. **Launch in stages** → internal dogfood → pilot users → controlled rollout; continuous A/B.
8. **Governance** → data retention policies, model cards, safety reports, changelogs.

---

## 17) Example learning flow (user journey)

1. **Onboarding:** 12‑minute diagnostic across LOs → initial knowledge vector.
2. **Planner:** selects *Backprop derivation (LO‑BP‑001)* at difficulty M.
3. **Tutor:** Socratic probes on chain rule; reveals step‑by‑step derivation with SymPy check.
4. **Assessor:** short coding lab: implement 2‑layer MLP; unit tests validate gradients.
5. **Critic:** verifies numeric gradient ≈ analytic gradient; flags mismatch >1e‑3.
6. **Update:** BKT/DKT increases mastery; schedules spaced repetition in 3 days.
7. **Recap:** concise summary + references; suggests next: *Optimization dynamics (LO‑OPT‑003)*.
